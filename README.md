![Banner Image for Ben Speaks](src/assets/images/banner.png)

An accessible Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app built with Expo + React Native + SQLite. This app allows users to take photos, name them, and use them as speech buttons for communication. Ben Speaks serves as a FOSS alternative to the popular AAC apps that often cost a lot of money that special needs families may not be able to afford.

## Features

- Text-to-Speech: Tap to hear words spoken aloud.

- SQLite Database: Store custom words and images locally.

- Customizable UI: A modular and accessible interface.
